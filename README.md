Metaphor
--------

This follows on from experiments with Meta-II, which you can find 
in another repository on GitHub. Metaphor implements some of the ideas that
I discussed in my blog post 
[Meta-II: An Early Meta-Compiler](http://onfoodandcoding.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/meta-ii-early-meta-compiler.html). I haven't yet implemented left-recursive
grammar rules, but grammar matches can now be captured in named variables, so
you can produce output which *looks* as though it was parsed by 
a left-recursive rule. (For example, see test-grammar.txt and 
test-example.txt. I got this idea from TreeMeta, which lets you do the same
thing, but with a more awkward mechanism.)

This is possibly the world's worst README file, because I don't have time
right now to write nice documentation which explains things properly. 
Sorry about that. If you want to use this but are puzzled by something, 
drop me a line.
